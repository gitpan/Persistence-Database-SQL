Persistence::Database::SQL - Object Persistence in SQL Databases. 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Persistence::Database::SQL;

  my $db = new Persistence::Database::SQL
    ( Engine => 'Postgres',
      Database => $database_name, 
      Table => $table_name,
      Template => $template_hashref );

  my (@objects) = $db->search
    ( Key => $key,
      Regex => $regex );

  for $obj (@objects) {
    $db->table('expired'); 
    $obj->commit();
    $db->table($table_name); 
    $obj->expire();
  }

  my $dbhandle = $db->dbhandle();

  my $query = "SELECT oid,* FROM $table_name WHERE $field=$value";
  my $sth = $dbhandle->prepare($query); $sth->execute();
  while (@row = $sth->fetchrow()) {
    my $obj = new Persistence::Object::Postgres
      ( __Dope => $db,
        __Oid => $row[0] );
    $obj->expire();
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a store of persistent objects using various DBMS
engines. It works in association with a lower level persistent object
implementation, such as Persistence::Object::Postgres. 

Using a template mapping object properties to PostgreSQL class fields,
it is possible to automatically generate DBMS fields out of the object
data, which allows you to use SQL indexing and querying facilities on
your database of persistent objects.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR 

=over 2

=item B<new()>

Creates a new Database Object.

  my $database = new Persistence::Database::SQL
    ( 
      Engine => 'Postgres',           # Required
      Database => $database_name, 
      Table => $table_name,
      Template => $template_hashref,

      Host => $db_host,               # Optional
      Port => $db_port,
      Username => $db_username,
      Password => $db_password 

      Createfields => $boolean,
      Createtables => $boolean
    );

Takes a hash argument with following possible keys:

B<Engine>

The name of the underlying DBMS engine, for which there must be a
Persistence::Object::Engine class available. Currently, the only
available engine is 'Postgres'. This attribute is required.

B<Database>

The name of the database. A database by this name must exist
previously within the DBMS system in use with sufficient priveleges
for the user. This attribute is required.

B<Table>

The table within the database to use for object storage. A table by
this name must exist previously within the DBMS system in use with
sufficient priveleges for the user. This attribute is required, and
can be later changed with the table() method.

B<Template>

A reference to a hash that maps persistent object key names to
database field names. Key names that are mapped in the template will
be extracted and stored in separate database fields. In the degenerate
case where you provide an empty hash for the mapping template, only
the complete object dump is stored.

The complete object dump will always be stored, in a database field
called __dump, which will be created if it doesn't exist. If the
database user doesn't have sufficient priveleges to alter tables, and
the __dump field doesn't exist in the database, commit() will fail.

This attribute is required, and can be later changed with the
template() method.

B<Host>

The name or IP address of the database server. A default value is
provided by the DBMS-specific object class if this attribute is
omitted.

B<Port>

The port on which the database server can be accessed. A default value
is provided by the DBMS-specific object class if this attribute is
omitted.

B<Username>

The username to use to acccess the database server. A default value,
usually the username of the user running the program, is provided by
the DBMS-specific object class if this attribute is omitted.

B<Password> 

The password for the user. A default value may be provided by the
DBMS-specific object class if this attribute is omitted, though it
would probably be an empty string.

B<Createfields> 

Whether or not new fields should be created in the database to meet
the needs of complying with the mapping template. If true, fields will
silently be created in the database. For this to work, the database
user must have sufficient priveleges within the database system.

If false, data will not be stored in a separate database field even if
a mapping for it exists in the template, unless the field in question
already exists in the database. 

The default is true. This attribute can be queried and changed on the
fly with the createfields() method.

B<Createtables> 

Whether or not new tables should be created in the database if they
are referenced but don't already exist. If true, tables will
automatically be created as needed. For this to work, the database
user must have sufficient priveleges within the database system.

If false, tables will not be automatically created, which will cause
commit() and load() to fail if asked to operate on a nonexistent
table.

The default is true. This attribute can be queried and changed on the
fly with the createtables() method. 

NOTE: This is not yet implemented. For the moment, tables are NOT
automatically created, regardless of the value of this attribute.

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=over 2

=item B<search()> 

Searches the database for objects whose field values match the regular
expression specified.

  $database->search 
    ( Key => $key,
      Regex => $regex ); 

=item B<dbhandle()> 

Returns the handle to the database connection. You could use this to
execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.

  $handle = $database->dbhandle()

=head1 BUGS

=over 2

=item * 

Error checking needs work.
